                <p>Our dream has always been to have a large yard where we could grow beauty and improve the land. We were able to realize that dream when in 2018 when we moved to our second home. We found a home on almost an acre in the foothills of Provo.
                    I began my search for what beautiful flowers I could add the currently barren yard. In my search I came across Floret Flower, and bought "A Cut Flower Garden" looking for ideas of fun things to plant. I had a list a mile long of all
                    the beautiful varieties I wanted to try out here. When we moved in, we mdae a few discovries. Deer were everpresent, and love to much on most flowers and plants. The yard was was laden with weeds. What had apeared to be green grass
                    in the listing photos was mothing more than yarrow, crabgrass and clover. And the more we looked, the more we found. The areas without noticiable plants were covered in puncturvine - the seed of which is the dreaded goathead. There
                    were millions of those goathead seeds all over our property. </p>


                <p>I began to wonder what we were thinking trying to cultivate this clay based weed magnet of a yard. Each time I spotted a weed, I'd google the best way to remove it, and the answer was always bad news. Horsetail, cheetgrass, puncturvine
                    and yarrow are not easy to stop. But we had some ideas. We had made friends with a local arborist who promised to give us truck loads of woodchips. It was somewhere in that Cut Garden book I learned about using cardboard as a weed
                    barrier. So we started collecting boxes making a plan. We decided to go all in and put a fence around the backyard to give our garden and orchard a shot against the deer. </p>


                <p>Through the end of winter and early spring, we spent weekend after weekend laying cardboard and covering it with wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow of various woodchips. More than 10 dumptruck loads of woodchips! We added a shed to the only
                    improved spot in the far backyard - a simple 10X20 concrete pad, which had some electrical wiring near by. This would be our future potting shed and workshop. In March we planted over 20 trees, which included 17 different varieties
                    of fruit trees. We constructed our garden beds for the veggie patch, and added a garden fence to keep the dog and future chickens out. Little by little the yard that felt overwhelming and hopeless began to take shape. </p>

                <p>Now that the fruit trees are planted and we have a spot to grow veggies, the next phase will be the cut garden. With deer kept out, and lots more space to plant, we are looking forward to a huge patch of cut flowers for the 2020 season.
